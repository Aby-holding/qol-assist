.SH "NAME"
\fBqol\-assist\fR \- Quality Of Life Assistance
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBqol\-assist [command]\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBqol\-assist\fR is a system level component to assist in migrations within an operating system, with a specific focus on combatting changes specific to so\-called "rolling release" systems\.
.
.P
\fBqol\-assist\fR is designed to be an unobtrusive component of the system update architecture, running versioned system migrations (such as user group inclusion) over time to keep existing users at feature parity with new installations\.
.
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
\fBlist\-users [admin all active system]\fR
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

Useful utility to gain insight into how the system views different user
accounts\. This command takes a single argument to control how the user
list is filtered\. This can be useful in debugging to determine which
accounts the system deems to be administrators, system, or human\.

.P
\fBtrigger\fR
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

This subcommand is typically invoked through the update architecture when
the `qol\-assist` package itself is updated\. Execution of this subcommand
will cause a state tracking file to be created to schedule `qol\-assist`
to start up on the next boot during the early init process\.
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fBmigrate\fR
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

This subcommand will only execute if a trigger file has been created
through the aforementioned `trigger` subcommand\. During early start up
the system state and QoL level will be evaluated, so that any pending
migrations from a higher level than the current system level will be
executed\. Care is taken to not blindly perform actions that are
unnecessary, and the newly reached system level will be recorded\. Future
migrations will not run earlier versioned migrations\.
.

\fBhelp\fR

Print the supported command set for the `qol\-assist(1)` binary\.

Print the version and license information, before quitting\.

.SH "FILES"
\fBqol\-assist\fR tracks state through some special files, and will recover in their absence\.
.
.P
\fB/var/lib/qol\-assist/trigger\fR
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

If this file exists, `qol\-assist migrate` will be started on the next boot during
the early init process\.
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fB/var/lib/qol\-assist/status\fR
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

This file describes the current migration level of the system, in order to
prevent unnecessary work between subsequent runs of `qol\-assist`\. In effect
this will mandate the current system migration level and any migrations from
an older level will not be run, preventing unnecessary work and boot time
regressions\.

The absence of this file is non fatal, all migrations will check the system
state before applying new changes\.
.

.IP "" 0
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
On success, 0 is returned\. A non\-zero return code signals a failure\.
